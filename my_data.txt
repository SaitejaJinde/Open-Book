A Flibbertigibbet is a whimsical creature from folklore, known for its flighty and chattering nature.
It is often described as a small, fairy-like being that flits from one place to another,
spreading rumors and harmless gossip. According to legend, Flibbertigibbets are attracted to
shiny objects and are most active during the twilight hours. They are not malicious,
but their constant chattering can be a nuisance.

The primary habitat of a Flibbertigibbet is an ancient, mossy forest.
They build their nests from spider silk and dew-covered leaves.
Their diet consists mainly of moonlight and wild berries.
